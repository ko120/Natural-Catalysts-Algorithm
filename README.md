# Natural-Catalysts-Algorithm

This project is focusing on developing algorithm to evaluate the enzyme performance from Natural Catalysts. Our algorithm determines the maximum velocity (Vmax) and Michalis Menten constant (km) based on an implementation of the Lineweaver Burk Plot to linearize the Michaelis Menten model and features a vector averaging method to rid of the noise.
